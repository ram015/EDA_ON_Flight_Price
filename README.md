# EDA_ON_Flight_Price
Flight Price Prediction Project Summary:

Introduction:
This project aims to predict flight prices based on various features such as airline, source, destination,
departure time, and duration. The dataset comprises flights from 2019 to 2020, with a focus on understanding patterns that influence ticket prices.

                                                              Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Summary:
Price Variation by Source and Destination:
  -Flights originating from Banglore to New Delhi are observed to be relatively expensive.
  -Flights between Chennai and Kolkata, as well as Banglore and Delhi, tend to be more budget-friendly.

Non-Stop vs. Multiple Stops:
  -Non-stop flights generally have lower prices compared to those with multiple stops.
  
Dependence on Departure Time:
  -Early morning flights are generally more affordable than daytime flights.
  -Peak hours, especially from 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM, are associated with higher ticket prices.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

  -The dataset was relatively clean, requiring minimal cleaning efforts.
 - Missing values were handled appropriately.
  T-he departure time was converted into separate columns for hours and minutes.

Visualization Highlights:
  -Bar chart: Average price based on the total number of stops.
  -Bar chart: Average price based on source and destination.
  -Scatter plot: Relationship between price, duration, and departure time.
  -3D scatter plot: Price distribution based on duration (hours and minutes) and departure hour.
                                                                                  Observations:
Source-Destination Dynamics:
  -Flights originating from Banglore to New Delhi are relatively expensive, possibly due to high demand or specific route characteristics. 
  -Contrarily, flights connecting Chennai to Kolkata and Banglore to Delhi tend to offer more budget-friendly options, potentially influenced by 
  competition or route popularity.

Stop Impact on Prices:
  -Non-stop flights are generally more economical than those with multiple stops. Passengers seeking cost-effective options may prefer 
  non-stop routes, while those valuing convenience might opt for direct flights.

Departure Time Influence:
  -Early morning flights emerge as a cost-effective choice, potentially attracting budget-conscious travelers. 
  -Peak hours, particularly from 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM, coincide with higher ticket prices, indicating potential demand spikes during these periods.

Project Overview
  -This Flight Price Prediction project successfully navigated through the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process, employing visualizations to unravel insights 
    from the dataset. 
  -The resulting clean data, enhanced with actionable features, lays a solid foundation for subsequent predictive modeling endeavors.
  -The insights gained from this EDA provide valuable direction for further analysis and modeling. Future steps may involve developing a predictive model leveraging 
  machine learning algorithms to enhance the project's utility for users seeking informed decisions when booking flights. 
  -The comprehensive README file on GitHub encapsulates the project's essence, ensuring accessibility and understanding for future reference.
